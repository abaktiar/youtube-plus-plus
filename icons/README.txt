ICON INSTRUCTIONS

You need to create or download the following icon files for the extension to work properly:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

Options for creating icons:
1. Use an image editor like Photoshop, GIMP, or online tools like Canva
2. Download free icons from sites like Flaticon, Iconfinder, or Icons8
3. Use a simple colored circle with a letter "S" (for Speed) in the center

Place all icon files in this directory before loading the extension into Chrome.

If you have ImageMagick installed, you can run the create_icons.sh script in the root directory to generate simple placeholder icons.
